#### `sugar. init_sugar (window_name, w, h, scale)`
- Initializes Sugarcoat for use.
- `w` and `h` are the width and height you want for your simulated screen resolution.
- `scale` is the scale factor you want for stretching your simulated resolution. You can change the behavior around scaling with the various `sugar.gfx.screen_...` functions.

&#8202;

#### `sugar. sugar_step ()`
- Updates the sugar subsystems that need updating.
- This function will already be called automatically if you use `love.update()` - otherwise you will have to call it in your code once every frame.

&#8202;

#### `sugar. shutdown_sugar ()`
- Shuts down the various sugarcoat subsystems.
- This function is automatically called on closing the application, unless you are using your own `love.run`.
- Since Love2D has a garbage collector (contrarily to C++ SUGAR), this function doesn't actually need to be called at any time.

&#8202;

#### `sugar. sys_battery ()`
- Get the state of the system's battery.
- Returns, in this order:
  - Percents of battery left
  - Whether the system is on battery (true) or if it is plugged in (false)
  - Battery life remaining (in seconds)

&#8202;

#### `sugar. after_render`
- Is a function callback you can define like so : `function sugar.after_render() --[[...]] end`
- If it is defined, it will be called automatically every frame, after the simulated screen is rendered to the actual screen. (or to a set canvas)
- This is intended to be used for post-processing, along with `sugar.gfx.render_to_canvas(...)`, as an alternative to the upcoming shader Sugar system.
- In this callback, all Sugar drawing functions will have undefined behavior. You should use the Love2D functions instead.

&#8202;

#### `sugar. S`
- A table that contains the content of all the subpackages in sugarcoat.
- You may call any sugarcoat function through `sugar.S.foo()`.
